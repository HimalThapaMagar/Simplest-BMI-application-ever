# BMI Calculator

## Overview

This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using Flutter. The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Flutter and understand the basics of building mobile applications. This application allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their BMI.

## Features

- Input fields for height and weight
- Button to calculate BMI
- Display of the calculated BMI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have Flutter installed on your development machine. For installation instructions, please refer to the official [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HimalThapaMagar/BMI-Calculator.git
   ```




## Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd bmi_calculator
```

### Install the dependencies:

```
### Run the application:

# Usage
Open the application on your emulator or physical device.
Enter your height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) in the respective fields.
Tap the "Calculate" button.
View your calculated BMI displayed on the screen.

## Future Improvements - Maybe I dunno for now
- Adding input validation
- Providing BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese)
- Enhancing UI/UX with better design and animations
- Supporting multiple units of measurement (e.g., feet/inches, pounds)
